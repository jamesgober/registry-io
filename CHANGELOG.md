## [1.0.0] - 2026-05-19

**First stable release.** The public API is now frozen for the
lifetime of v1.x under the contract in
[`docs/STABILITY-1.0.md`](docs/STABILITY-1.0.md). Every behavioral
guarantee, performance target, and panic-isolation rule documented
across the 0.x line is locked in here.

No new public API in this release. v1.0.0 promotes the API surface
finalized in v0.9.0 to a stable contract; no compile-time or
behavioral change is required to upgrade from v0.9.0 to v1.0.0.

### What's locked in by v1.0.0

#### Public types

- `HandlerId` — opaque, `Copy + Eq + Hash + Debug + Display`,
  `as_u64()` diagnostic accessor.
- `PanicInfo<'a>` — `handler_id()`, `payload()`, `message()`, `Debug`.
- `SyncRegistry<E>` — full sync surface: `new`, `with_capacity`,
  `register`, `register_with_priority`, `register_guard`,
  `register_guard_with_priority`, `unregister`, `clear`, `contains`,
  `handler_count`, `is_empty`, `on_panic`, `clear_panic_callback`,
  `notify`. Plus `Default + Debug + Send + Sync`.
- `HandlerGuard<E>` — `#[must_use]`, `id()`, `forget()`, Drop
  semantics specified.
- `AsyncRegistry<E>` *(feat: async)* — full async surface mirroring
  the sync side, plus `notify` (concurrent) and `notify_sequential`.
- `AsyncHandlerGuard<E>` *(feat: async)* — same shape as
  `HandlerGuard`.
- `pub const VERSION` — crate version string.
- `pub mod sync`, `pub mod r#async` *(feat: async)*.

#### Behavioral contract

- **Lock-free + zero-allocation** sync notify hot path. Verified
  by `tests/zero_alloc.rs` (`dhat`-backed, 100 000 calls).
- **Panic isolation** via `std::panic::catch_unwind` for both sync
  and async dispatch. Sibling handlers continue; `notify` does not
  unwind into the caller.
- **Priority ordering**: higher fires first; equal priority fires
  in registration order (stable).
- **`HandlerId` uniqueness** within a registry for that registry's
  lifetime. Ids are not comparable across registries.
- **`Send + Sync`** on every public type for any
  `E: Send + Sync + 'static`.
- **RAII unregistration**: drop the guard, the registration drops.
  Registry-before-guard drop is safe.

#### Performance contract (measured headroom)

| Operation                                       | Target     | Measured  |
|-------------------------------------------------|-----------:|----------:|
| Sync notify, 1 handler, 1 thread                | `<20 ns`   | 10.1 ns   |
| Sync notify, 4 handlers, 1 thread               | `<50 ns`   | 12.5 ns   |
| Sync notify, 16 handlers, 1 thread              | `<200 ns`  | 26.0 ns   |
| Sync notify, 4 handlers, 16 threads contended   | `<50 ns`   | 24.7 ns   |
| Async notify (concurrent), 1 handler            | `<500 ns`  | 177 ns    |
| Zero heap allocations on sync notify no-panic   | required   | verified  |

Full numbers and reproduction in
[`docs/PERFORMANCE.md`](docs/PERFORMANCE.md).

#### Cargo metadata

- **Edition** `2024`
- **MSRV** `1.85` (frozen for v1.x)
- **License** `Apache-2.0 OR MIT`
- **Features** `std`, `sync`, `async`, `hybrid`, `metrics` (reserved),
  `dhat-heap` (dev-only). All additive.

### Added in 1.0.0 specifically

- **`[1.0.0]`** stability block in [`docs/STABILITY-1.0.md`](docs/STABILITY-1.0.md)
  now reads as "in effect" rather than "planned" — every clause is
  binding from this release forward.
- **`docs/SECURITY.md`** updated to record the 1-CPU-hour fuzz
  soak result (clean, no findings) and to list the maintenance
  gates (`cargo audit`, `cargo deny check`, `cargo public-api diff`)
  with their v1.0.0 status (all clean).

### Changed

- **Version refs swept** across the entire codebase from `0.9.0` to
  `1.0.0`: `Cargo.toml`, `src/lib.rs#html_root_url`, `README.md`
  install snippets (both sync and async blocks), all
  `docs/*.md` headers and footers.
- **`README.md` Status section** rewritten: "Active development" /
  "API not yet frozen" language removed. Now leads with
  "Stable. Production-ready." plus the measured headline numbers
  and the locked-in guarantees.
- **`docs/STABILITY-1.0.md`** language tightened: future-tense
  hedges ("will not change", "planned for the RC") replaced with
  present-tense statements of the in-effect contract.

### Verified (v1.0.0 release gates)

```
cargo fmt --all -- --check                                OK
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings  OK
cargo test --all-features                                 OK (149 tests)
cargo test --features dhat-heap --test zero_alloc         OK
cargo build --all-features --examples                     OK
RUSTFLAGS="-D warnings" cargo build --all-features --examples  OK
cargo doc --no-deps --all-features                        OK (-D warnings)
```

Cross-platform CI (Linux/macOS/Windows × stable + MSRV 1.85.0)
passes the same gate. Public-API diff vs v0.9.0: empty (no surface
change; v1.0.0 is a stability promotion of v0.9.0's API).

### Skipped

- A `1.0.0-rc.1` release candidate. The full 0.x line was effectively
  the RC track: nine published `0.x.0` releases with cumulative
  hardening (proptest, fuzz, leak checks, dhat-verified zero-alloc),
  performance verification against the contract, full documentation
  pass, and four runnable integration-pattern examples. There is
  nothing for an RC soak to discover that the 0.x line did not
  already shake out.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-05-19

Documentation pass. Three new long-form docs land in this release —
the v1.0 stability contract, the internal architecture walk-through,
and the per-platform behavior notes — and the public rustdoc surface
is now audit-complete (every non-trivial public item carries at least
one runnable `# Examples` block).

This is the gate to the `1.0.0-rc.1` cut.

### Added

- **`docs/STABILITY-1.0.md`** — the v1.0 stability contract. Lists
  every public item that is frozen for the lifetime of v1.x with its
  behavioral guarantees; specifies what may still change in v1.x
  (additions, internal details); pins MSRV at 1.85, edition at 2024,
  license at Apache-2.0 OR MIT; defines deprecation and yank policies;
  enumerates the CI gates that enforce the contract.
- **`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`** — internal structure walk-through.
  ASCII big-picture diagram of the storage model; full file-tree map
  (src/, tests/, benches/, examples/, fuzz/); hot-path code excerpt
  with measured-cost decomposition; slow-path rcu pattern explained;
  async-side mirroring rules; design-decision rationale (why
  `E: Send + Sync + 'static` at the type level, why monotonic ids,
  why panic isolation by default, why no embedded async runtime);
  "adding a new feature" checklist for contributors.
- **`docs/PLATFORM-NOTES.md`** — per-platform behavior nuances.
  Platform support matrix (Linux/macOS/Windows on stable + MSRV;
  WASM and no_std listed unsupported); per-platform behavior notes
  including the Windows SEH unwind characteristics; build
  prerequisites; CI matrix walk-through; known quirks
  (`dhat::Profiler` process-global constraint, stable-Rust feature
  gates, allocator interactions); bug-reporting checklist for
  platform-specific issues.

### Changed

- **Rustdoc audit complete.** The `AsyncRegistry` methods
  `register_guard_with_priority`, `clear`, `handler_count`,
  `is_empty`, `contains`, `on_panic`, and `clear_panic_callback`
  previously had documentation but lacked `# Examples` sections;
  each now has at least one runnable example, exercised by
  `cargo test --doc`. Doctest count: 26 → **46**.
- **`pub const VERSION`** now has a runnable `# Examples` block.
- **README.md** Documentation section surfaces all five long-form
  docs (`API.md`, `PATTERNS.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `PERFORMANCE.md`,
  `SECURITY.md`, `STABILITY-1.0.md`, `PLATFORM-NOTES.md`).
- **README.md** Status section rewritten to highlight v0.9.0 as the
  pre-RC docs pass; previous-release blurbs reflowed.
- **Version footers and prose refs** swept across `docs/API.md`,
  `docs/PATTERNS.md`, `docs/PERFORMANCE.md`, `docs/SECURITY.md` from
  `v0.8.0` to `v0.9.0`. README install snippets bumped from `"0.8"`
  to `"0.9"`. `src/lib.rs#html_root_url` bumped to `0.9.0`.
- **Cargo.toml** — version `0.8.0` → `0.9.0`. No new dependencies.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-05-19

Integration-validation milestone. Four canonical integration patterns
are now documented end-to-end (hot reload, audit fan-out, metric event
collection, transaction state-change hooks), each backed by a runnable
example. Documentation accuracy was swept across every `.md` file
under the repository to bring stale version strings, copyright
footers, and dependency snippets in line with the current release.

### Added

- **`docs/PATTERNS.md`** — integration-pattern reference covering the
  four use cases the crate was built to serve. Each pattern names the
  problem, sketches the solution shape, contrasts with the obvious
  channel/mutex alternatives, and links to its runnable example.
  Closes with a "choosing between sync and async" decision matrix and
  a "mistakes to avoid" section.
- **`examples/pattern_hot_reload.rs`** — config-lib-style hot reload.
  A single `Config` value owns an `ArcSwap<Snapshot>` plus an
  `Arc<SyncRegistry<Snapshot>>`; subscribers re-derive local state
  from each new snapshot in ~10 ns per handler.
- **`examples/pattern_audit_fanout.rs`** — three different sinks
  (stdout, file-tee, critical-alert) attached via `register_guard`;
  drop-the-sink-to-deregister semantics make detach trivial; panic
  isolation between sinks comes for free.
- **`examples/pattern_metric_event.rs`** — one lock-free atomic
  aggregator + one batching exporter against a `SyncRegistry<MetricEvent>`.
  Drives 1 000 simulated requests through 3 event kinds.
- **`examples/pattern_transaction_hooks.rs`** — priority-ordered
  transaction hooks (WAL flush → cache invalidate → replication ship →
  metrics record) using `register_with_priority`.
- **Expanded `docs/API.md`** — the previously-condensed async block
  ("`unregister / clear / contains / handler_count / is_empty`",
  "`on_panic / clear_panic_callback`") is now seven individual
  sections, each with its own description, signature, parameters,
  return value, and at least one runnable example. Matches the
  per-method depth of the sync section. Brings the async surface to
  parity with the directive: every public item has its own multi-
  example section.

### Changed

- **All documentation footers and prose version refs** updated to
  v0.8.0 in `docs/API.md`, `docs/PERFORMANCE.md`, `docs/SECURITY.md`,
  and `docs/PATTERNS.md`. The README async-feature install snippet
  bumped from `version = "0.7"` to `version = "0.8"`.
- **`src/lib.rs`** — `#![doc(html_root_url)]` bumped from `0.5.0`
  (which had been stale for three releases) to `0.8.0`. Going forward
  this constant is part of the release checklist.
- **`README.md`** — Documentation section now surfaces `PATTERNS.md`
  and `SECURITY.md` alongside `API.md` and `PERFORMANCE.md`.

### Fixed

- **Stale doc versions.** v0.5.0 footers in `API.md`, v0.6.0 footers
  in `PERFORMANCE.md`, v0.4.0 install snippet in older README copies,
  and `html_root_url = "0.5.0"` in `src/lib.rs` had all drifted away
  from the actual crate version. Every reference is now sync'd to
  v0.8.0 in a single sweep; release checklist updated to make this
  automatic next time.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-05-19

Hardening milestone. Property-based invariant testing,
`Arc`-strong-count leak verification, a fuzz-target scaffold for
`cargo-fuzz`, and a published threat model.

### Added

- **`tests/proptest_invariants.rs`** — six property tests over random
  operation sequences: register-then-unregister round-trip leaves the
  registry empty; `notify` fires exactly once per registered handler;
  handler ids stay unique across arbitrary churn; `handler_count`
  matches external bookkeeping; stale ids always return `false` from
  `unregister`; `clear()` does not let subsequent ids collide with
  pre-clear ids.
- **`tests/leak_check.rs`** — three `Arc::strong_count` canary tests
  covering 10 000 register / unregister cycles, `clear()` after 100
  registrations, and registry drop while 50 handlers are live.
- **`fuzz/` workspace scaffold** — `cargo-fuzz`-ready Cargo manifest
  plus two fuzz targets:
  - `handler_churn` — random sequences of register / unregister /
    clear / notify ops against a fresh `SyncRegistry`, with invariant
    checks after each step. Includes panicky handlers in the rotation.
  - `event_payload` — registers a fixed handler set and dispatches
    arbitrary event payloads, exercising the dispatch path against
    adversarial bytes.
  - `fuzz/.gitignore` excludes `target/`, `corpus/`, `artifacts/`,
    `coverage/`.
- **`docs/SECURITY.md`** — threat model, unsafe-code discipline, panic
  isolation in detail, fuzzing methodology, leak/zero-alloc
  verification summary, CI gate inventory, vulnerability reporting
  process.
- **`proptest` dev-dependency** — `proptest = "1"` (default features
  off, `std` only) — used exclusively in `tests/proptest_invariants.rs`.

### Changed

- **`Cargo.toml`** — version `0.6.0` → `0.7.0`; added `proptest`
  dev-dep.
- **`.github/workflows/ci.yml`** — bumped `actions/cache@v4` to
  `actions/cache@v5`. v5 declares `using: node24` in its manifest, so
  the `FORCE_JAVASCRIPT_ACTIONS_TO_NODE24` env var added in 0.6.0 is no
  longer needed and was removed. CI runs are now warning-free for the
  Node.js deprecation pipeline.

### Security

- Public API remains free of `unsafe`. Verified by inspection;
  documented in `docs/SECURITY.md`.
- Panic isolation invariants newly covered by property tests and fuzz
  targets in addition to the existing example-based tests.
- Memory-leak posture across register / unregister churn and registry
  drop newly covered by `tests/leak_check.rs`.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-05-19

Performance verification milestone. The full benchmark suite has been
executed, the Performance Contract numbers from `.dev/ROADMAP.md` are
**all met with significant headroom**, and the zero-allocation property
of `SyncRegistry::notify` is verified by a `dhat`-backed test.

### Added

- **`benches/contention.rs`** — dedicated thread-contention sweep for
  `SyncRegistry::notify`. Combinatorial matrix of `{1, 4, 16, 64}`
  notifying threads × `{1, 4, 16}` handlers. Each benchmark uses
  `iter_custom` + `thread::scope` to put the worker spawn inside the
  timed region and reports ns *per notify call*.
- **`tests/zero_alloc.rs`** — dhat-based heap accounting test that
  verifies `notify()` allocates zero blocks across 100 000 calls with
  both an empty registry and an 8-handler registry. Gated behind the
  new `dhat-heap` feature so the global allocator swap doesn't affect
  other tests/benches.
- **`dhat-heap` Cargo feature** — when enabled, swaps the global
  allocator to `dhat::Alloc` for the zero-alloc test. `dhat 0.3` is a
  dev-dependency (does not propagate to downstream crates).
- **`docs/PERFORMANCE.md`** — extensively rewritten with **measured**
  numbers from the dev machine baseline (Windows 11, Intel x86-64,
  Rust 1.95, MSVC). Includes:
  - Headline sync notify table vs Performance Contract targets.
  - Full contention sweep (1 → 64 threads × 1 → 16 handlers).
  - Async notify table for both concurrent and sequential dispatch.
  - Register / unregister slow-path latency at `N = 0, 16, 100, 1000`.
  - Cost model, hot-path code walk, slow-path rcu pattern, memory
    footprint accounting.
  - Dispatch-mode guidance ("when to use concurrent vs sequential").
  - Reproduction commands for every bench.

### Changed

- **`src/async_registry/mod.rs`** — `notify` rewritten to do a single
  pass over the handler snapshot, building parallel `ids` and `wrapped`
  vectors instead of an intermediate `pairs` Vec. Saves one Vec
  allocation per `notify()` call. Functionally identical.
- **`Cargo.toml`** — version `0.5.0` → `0.6.0`. Added `[[bench]]` entry
  for `contention`. Added `dhat = "0.3"` dev-dep and `dhat-heap = []`
  feature.
- **`.github/workflows/ci.yml`** — set
  `FORCE_JAVASCRIPT_ACTIONS_TO_NODE24: true` so `actions/cache@v4`
  (still on Node 20 internally) opts into Node 24 today instead of
  emitting the deprecation warning on every CI run.

### Verified

- All sync-notify targets in the Performance Contract met:
  `1 handler / 1 thread = 10.1 ns` (target `<20 ns`),
  `4 handlers / 1 thread = 12.5 ns` (target `<50 ns`),
  `4 handlers / 16 threads = 24.7 ns` (target `<50 ns`).
- Async-notify target met: `concurrent 1 handler = 177 ns`
  (target `<500 ns`).
- Zero-allocation property on `notify()` hot path confirmed by `dhat`
  across 100 000 calls.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-05-19

This release adds the **asynchronous** registry surface (`AsyncRegistry`)
behind the `async` feature flag, plus the supporting future-combinator
primitives required to run async handlers with the same panic-isolation
guarantees as the sync side.

### Added

- **`AsyncRegistry<E>`** — async-handler counterpart to `SyncRegistry`.
  Same lock-free `ArcSwap`-backed storage; handlers return a `'static`
  future of `()`. Methods: `new`, `with_capacity`, `register`,
  `register_with_priority`, `register_guard`, `register_guard_with_priority`,
  `unregister`, `clear`, `contains`, `handler_count`, `is_empty`,
  `on_panic`, `clear_panic_callback`, `notify` (concurrent), and
  `notify_sequential`. Re-exported at the crate root as
  `registry_io::AsyncRegistry` when the `async` feature is on.
- **`AsyncHandlerGuard<E>`** — RAII guard for async registrations.
  `#[must_use]`, drop-to-unregister, `forget()` to detach. Holds a
  `Weak<AsyncRegistry<E>>` so the registry can be dropped before the guard
  safely.
- **`crate::future_ext::CatchUnwind`** — internal future adapter that wraps
  each handler future and catches panics escaping `poll`. Mirrors
  `std::panic::catch_unwind` for the async path.
- **`crate::future_ext::JoinAll`** — internal future combinator that drives
  a `Vec<F>` of futures concurrently and resolves to a `Vec<F::Output>` in
  input order. Written in-tree to keep the dependency surface minimal
  (no `futures-util`).
- **`pub mod r#async`** — public module exposing the async registry and
  guard at `registry_io::r#async`.
- **Tests** — 38 new async integration tests covering registration, notify
  (both modes), priority ordering, panic isolation in both dispatch modes,
  guard drop semantics, panic-callback replacement and clearing, and
  custom panic payload round-trips. All exercised via `#[tokio::test]`.
- **Bench** — `benches/async_notify.rs` with concurrent and sequential
  scenarios at handler counts `0, 1, 4, 16`.
- **Examples** — `examples/async_basic.rs` and
  `examples/async_concurrent_vs_sequential.rs`. Both gated by
  `required-features = ["async"]` in `Cargo.toml`.
- **Documentation** — `docs/API.md` extended with the full `AsyncRegistry`
  and `AsyncHandlerGuard` reference, each with multiple runnable code
  examples. `README.md` quick-start now includes an async snippet.

### Changed

- **`Cargo.toml`** — version bumped to `0.5.0`; added `[[bench]]` for
  `async_notify` and `[[example]]` entries for the two new async examples,
  all gated by `required-features = ["async"]`. `tokio` dev-dependency now
  also enables the `time` feature (used by the
  `async_concurrent_vs_sequential` example).
- **`src/lib.rs`** — `panic` module is now gated on
  `any(feature = "sync", feature = "async")` (it's shared by both
  registries); `PanicInfo` re-export updated accordingly. New
  feature-gated `pub mod r#async;` declaration with `#[path]` pointing at
  `async_registry/mod.rs`.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-05-19

This release ships the complete synchronous foundation: a fully functional
`SyncRegistry`, RAII handler guards, priority ordering, and panic isolation.
Phases 0.2.0, 0.3.0, and 0.4.0 from the roadmap are folded into a single
milestone.

### Added

- **`SyncRegistry<E>`** — generic, lock-free, panic-isolating event
  registry. Stores handlers as `Arc<dyn Fn(&E) + Send + Sync + 'static>`
  inside an `arc_swap::ArcSwap<Vec<...>>` snapshot.
  - `new`, `with_capacity`, `Default`, `Debug`.
  - `register` (default priority `0`) and
    `register_with_priority(priority, handler)`.
  - `register_guard` and `register_guard_with_priority` returning a
    `HandlerGuard` (RAII).
  - `unregister(id) -> bool`, `clear`, `contains`, `handler_count`,
    `is_empty`.
  - `notify(&event)` hot path: lock-free, allocation-free in the no-panic
    case, `#[inline]`. Each handler is wrapped in `std::panic::catch_unwind`.
  - `on_panic(callback)` and `clear_panic_callback()` for handler-panic
    observability.
- **`HandlerId`** — opaque, `Copy + Eq + Hash + Debug + Display` identifier
  with internal atomic-counter generator.
- **`PanicInfo<'a>`** — typed wrapper around a caught panic payload
  exposing `handler_id()`, `payload()`, and `message()`.
- **`HandlerGuard<E>`** — `#[must_use]` RAII handle returned by
  `register_guard*`. Drops to unregister; `forget()` consumes without
  unregistering. Holds a `Weak<SyncRegistry<E>>` so registry-before-guard
  drop order is safe.
- **Priority ordering** — descending priority on `notify`; equal priority
  fires in registration order. Insertion is `O(log N + N)` via
  `Vec::partition_point` + `Vec::insert`.
- **Panic isolation** — one panicking handler does not stop siblings or
  propagate to the caller. Second-order panics inside an `on_panic`
  callback are caught and dropped.
- **Benchmarks** — `benches/sync_notify.rs` (handler count + thread
  contention) and `benches/register_unregister.rs` (slow-path latency).
- **Examples** — `basic`, `priority`, `guards`, `panic_isolation`,
  `concurrent`.
- **Documentation** — `docs/API.md` (full API with multiple examples per
  item) and `docs/PERFORMANCE.md` (cost model and benchmark methodology).
- **Integration tests** — `tests/sync_registry.rs`, `tests/priority.rs`,
  `tests/panic_isolation.rs`, `tests/guards.rs`, `tests/concurrent.rs`.

### Changed

- **MSRV** bumped from `1.75` to `1.85` to support edition 2024.
- **Cargo features** — `sync` and `async` now explicitly imply `std`.
  Default features remain `["std", "sync"]`.
- **README** — replaced placeholder quick-start with working code examples
  for register/notify, priority ordering, RAII guards, and panic isolation.
- **`lib.rs`** — enabled `#![warn(clippy::pedantic)]` per directives; added
  `extern crate alloc` and feature-gated `extern crate std`.

### Security

- All handler invocations wrapped in `catch_unwind` to prevent
  unwind-related state corruption in callers.
- No `unsafe` code in the public API.
